I was 19 years old when the Occupy Wall Street protests started. I went on YouTube to see why the protesters were there, camping out night after night, and I learned about income inequality and how the rich were getting richer. And I started to realize there’s a lot we don’t have control over, like our healthcare and how we pay for it, a problem I’ve seen over and over among my friends and family.  \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMy sister Fadeline was in a car accident and even with health insurance wound up with medical debt. “I racked up over $20,000 worth of bills at the hospital I don’t know how,” she told me. And her copays are as high as $75. “It just makes it hard for me to want to go to the doctor sometimes until I'm like more financially better and ready to start going and doing all the appointments.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring Bernie Sanders’ run for president in 2016, I began to believe in a system where people could go to the doctor without worrying about drowning in medical debt. I started questioning what I’d accepted as normal. So, a year ago, I joined the Democratic Socialists of America.  And when Bernie was running in the primary we canvassed and phone banked for him.

If there weren’t someone running on the platform I believe in, I would not [vote] for president.” He plans to vote for the Green Party candidate Howie Hawkins. But many of us are planning to vote for Joe Biden. Milo Keogh is also a member of the DSA, “I think I’ll vote for Joe just because Trump is a dangerous guy, but I’m not in a place where I could convince people to vote for him or campaign for him at all.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI’ll also vote for Joe Biden but I still want more for the country. So I’m putting my political and organizing energy elsewhere, like fighting for a higher minimum wage in Florida.

But because of my legal status, I couldn’t. My sister Eva could though. She was a year older and she had first priority when it came to obtaining documentation. My parents paid for her to apply for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, but they couldn’t pay for both of us.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEva:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E Oh, it made all of the difference, having DACA.

It was a life changer, you know. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EJuan:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E That’s what I wanted too. But during my junior year of high school, my dad was unexpectedly deported back to Mexico. Without my dad around, my mom’s job at a flower nursery wasn’t enough to cover the bills and play for the DACA application of $495. Also, it was almost impossible for me to find a job without DACA. The only other option in Stockton, California was to go to work in the fields. So during my senior year, I got a job in a fruit packaging warehouse and I got paid under the table, like most undocumented field workers. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E[Music changes]\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EJuan:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E Everyday after school, I rush over to this big stuffy warehouse and start packaging cherries. I stand at the same spot for hours, trying to move my hands and open the bags faster than the cherries falling on the ground. I’m exhausted. And I’m thinking to myself, “Why is this my only option? Why can’t I just have a regular job like my friends or Eva? And can this damn machine slow down?!” \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEventually the bell rings, notifying us it’s time to clock out. By now, It’s 1 a.m. I go home and start whatever homework I have due the next day. This was my routine my senior year. School. Work. Grieve for my dad in silence. Repeat. My goal was to save up for my DACA application, but the reality is most of the money went to help around the house. As my senior year was coming to an end, it became more urgent. I was scared I would have to put off college. But then I got a surprise.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EJuan:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E [Paper crinkles] Here’s the note I got…”Sometimes the American Dream comes true … with a little help.

I was so overwhelmed with emotions, I couldn’t believe it! I turned in my application just before Trump’s election. It would take nearly a year until I finally received my official Employment Authorization Card. I finally had temporary legal status. I immediately applied for a job, opened a bank account, got my drivers license, saved up some money and moved out of my house to the city. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAll the things I wanted to do but couldn’t before getting DACA. I wanted to take full advantage of the opportunities I now had, or at least temporarily had. So I was able to find a job at a fashion boutique store and a place to live, I was able to buy my own bed and my own furniture. I was doing things all on my own. On the other hand, my sister? She let her DACA expire. She didn’t want to continue paying the money.

I struggled more without it.

I got a taste of what my sister went through once the coronavirus pandemic hit. I was starting to feel comfortable in my new adult life when the governor ordered the closure of non-essential businesses. Clearly that meant my job at the boutique would close, and I was furloughed. The idea of losing my job scared me, and I figured I’d be back where I started. Then I learned that I would be eligible for unemployment benefits through the state of California, something my sister Eva can’t access because of her current status.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEva:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E No government aid, no government funding, nothing because I’m not documented.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EJuan:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E Despite her legal status, my sister is still working.

It’s about whether or not there will be food on the table or even a place to live. If you are undocumented, you don’t qualify for the Federal CARES Act, which provides economic assistance for U.S. citizens. But in April, Governor Newsom announced his plan to get $75 million in statewide funds for immigrant families impacted by COVID-19. However, it’s not clear if my family will get any of those limited funds. So we still have reason to worry.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEva:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E If I stopped working that would mean my income would completely stop.

This program for young immigrants like us has been debated in Congress and threats to end it are ongoing. While the Supreme Court upheld the program for now, it’s fate will probably depend on the next presidency — Trump or Biden. But for now, my sister and I have each other’s back no matter what, even though we still can’t decide on which Rihanna song is best.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EAlso featured on \u003Ca class=\"link blue underline underline-hover hover-dark-red\" href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.radiotopia.fm\u002Fpodcasts\u002Fadult-ish\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EAdult ISH podcast\u003C\u002Fa\u003E distributed by Radiotopia.\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E";ai.audioWaveform="WzAuNzc0LDAuMjc2LDAuNTYxLDAuNDYyLDAuNjUxLDAuNTg3LDAuMzYyLDAuNzY5LDAuNjMsMC42MTUsMC40NzIsMC40MzEsMC40MjUsMC41ODUsMC41MjYsMC41ODUsMC41MiwwLjY3OSwwLjQ4OSwwLjQ4NCwwLjU1LDEsMC45NzEsMC44MjMsMC43NSwwLjU2NiwwLjQyNSwwLjU4NiwwLjQxOCwwLjUzNiwwLjY0NywwLjQ3NywwLjM0NiwwLjc2NSwwLjYzNiwwLjcsMC40NDUsMC42MjgsMC43NjIsMC40ODksMC41NTgsMC41NzcsMC4zODgsMC4zNzEsMC40MjEsMC40LDAuNTYyLDAuNDU5LDAuNTQ5LDAuNDQ3LDAuNDQyLDAuNTIyLDAuMjYzLDAuNjAxLDAuNzcsMC4zMzUsMC40NzYsMC40NzEsMC40MTQsMC40OTMsMC40NDIsMC40NDIsMC40ODIsMC4zODksMC41MjQsMC40ODYsMC41ODYsMC4zNjUsMC41MjcsMC40OTIsMC42NTMsMC41NDYsMC42MDMsMC40MTMsMC40NjksMC40NTUsMC40NzMsMC40NzMsMC4zMTYsMC41NDksMC40ODUsMC42MzgsMC40MDUsMC43MzEsMC45MTYsMC42MDUsMC41ODYsMC40NDUsMC40MTQsMC40OTQsMC42MDIsMC40NzcsMC40ODgsMC41NzgsMC40NzYsMC40ODIsMC40NjMsMC40NTMsMC40ODUsMC40NzYsMC41MzEsMC40NjIsMC40OTgsMC40MjEsMC4zMzUsMC41OTksMC42MDksMC44MjgsMC44MDYsMC4yMjhd";ai.slug=ak;ai.authorslug=q;al.type=a;al.feature=b;al.format=d;al.location=B;al.audioURL="https:\u002F\u002Fwww.podtrac.com\u002Fpts\u002Fredirect.mp3\u002Faudio.wnyc.org\u002Fradiorookies\u002Fradiorookies071320_madisonhall.mp3";al.title=am;al.author=o;al.date=I;al.featureImage="articles\u002Fmadison_expecting-the-unexpected_feature-edit.jpg";al.featureImageSmall="articles\u002Fmadison_expecting-the-unexpected_feature-edit-small.jpg";al.featureImageCaption="Madison Hall poses for a photo with five friends.

And our fortunes are tied to the city’s. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI’ve been thinking about the political narrative of places like my hometown, and how that may not hold for the future.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERecently I went downtown to meet up with my friend Kelsey Fassett. We went to elementary and middle school together. The neighborhood where Kelsey grew up is full of families with parents who worked for Boeing. The neat 2-story houses probably look to an outsider like the typical “American dream.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“That was the blueprint for a lot of people our parents’ age,” she said. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople are proud of this heritage of blue-collar success that Trump jumped on. But Kelsey is quick to point out that she’s on a different path. She goes to a state college and is a computer science major. She’s excited to work a tech job in the future — something with a lot of spreadsheets. “I am not like most people. The idea of sitting and crunching numbers all day sounds like a dream to me. That sounds awesome. I just love sitting and doing calculations and busy work. I love it,” she said.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe talked about how even ten years ago, that decision to work in computer science would have been really rare, but now many kids in the area are leaving to take on Seattle jobs. Manufacturing doesn’t pay the bills the way it used to, and it’s not as stable anymore.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI’ve lived here all my life. When my parents were searching for a place to raise a family, they chose Everett partially because it was affordable and safe for kids, according to my mom Shobhna Hendry. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“We were looking for a home that would have a backyard and be spacious plus in a good school district,” she said. “We know many families that have stayed here for generations. But that wasn’t something we were expecting — that you and your sister would be here.” \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"mw5 center f7 gray\"\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" class=\"db lazyload\" src=\"articles\u002FSuryaHendry_AmeliaEarhartPic-crop.jpg\"\u003E\nReporter Surya Hendry in her childhood, dressed up as aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart.

Other parents want their kids to follow in their footsteps — work for Boeing. Stay in Everett. Build a family here.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECharlie Aust graduated high school in 2017, and has worked at Boeing for almost two years. His stepfather did maintenance as a subcontractor for Boeing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“I am what’s called an assembler installer. I work on the 767 planes,” he said. “I don't feel like I belong in this industry necessarily. It's mostly an opportunity thing because, you know, the job pays well and Boeing obviously, as a very large corporation, is going to offer a healthy benefits package, right? It's a good decision objectively for a lot of people in the area.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECharlie says people who were hired right after him are getting laid off, and he worries about getting laid off too. In the spring, Boeing announced a planned \u003Ca class=\"link blue underline underline-hover hover-dark-red\" href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fboeing.mediaroom.com\u002Fnews-releases-statements?item=130673\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E10% reduction\u003C\u002Fa\u003E in its workforce.

So, recently, I asked my mom a really big question: \u003Ci\u003EWhat do you think would happen in this area if Boeing left Everett?\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHer response: “I think that Everett would see a larger depression in the economy than they’re already seeing, partly due to the pandemic.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe’re both invested in what happens to Boeing, even though my parents don’t work there and I went to college more than 800 miles away. “Yeah, because at the end of the day, we’re interconnected,” my mom said. We like our neighborhood, which is filled with young families who might not be able to keep their houses during a recession. And my dad’s legal business relies on Boeing employees having some expendable income. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI decided to talk to my local representative, Democrat Jared Mead, about the future of Everett as a company town. He’s 29 years old, and he represents the experiences of my generation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“I lived with my mom until I was in my early 20s until I graduated college because that’s just what our generation is used to,” he told me when I asked him about how our prospects compare to earlier generations. “I had a long conversation with [my mom] just a few weeks ago about this exact thing. Most people have not had to deal with what our generation is now dealing with with the cost of living, the four-year degree price, the student loan debt interest. All of that. There’s a romanticized version of what a big corporation can do for a family,” Mead said.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMead said now most people here in their early 20s can’t buy a house. He couldn’t afford to buy a house in the area where he grew up. His father-in-law was a Boeing “lifer” who got a taste of the classic middle-class lifestyle. “He’s now in his early fifties. He’s been there 35, 36 years. And he lives in the house that he bought with his first two years of Boeing paychecks,” he said.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo me, this almost sounds imaginary. Many of my friends are leaving because they can make more money elsewhere. Or they feel like Charlie Aust does, that manufacturing might not offer the kind of career they want long-term. “So it's kind of something I wrestle with myself about whether I want to stay at this job that I don't exactly love, you know, and get the you know, the money that they are willing to pay their people or, you know, take that loss financially and go somewhere else where I might enjoy it more,” he said.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYoung people like me have big decisions to make about whether to stay in our town or leave. And COVID and the economic recession aren’t making things any clearer. I just hope that my peers have the choice to stay here in Everett and build a successful future. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EAlso featured on NPR\u002FWBUR’s \u003Ca class=\"link blue underline underline-hover hover-dark-red\" href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Fhereandnow\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EHere and Now\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E";ay.audioWaveform="WzAuNTQ3LDAuNTExLDAuMzU5LDAuMTUsMC4xOTQsMC4xOTgsMC4yMzYsMC4zMTUsMC4zMzIsMC4zNjIsMC41NzksMC4zODksMC41MTQsMC4zNDcsMC40NTksMC42MzYsMC41MiwwLjI1MSwwLjQ5NSwwLjUzNSwwLjU0LDAuMzA0LDAuMzU4LDAuNDI3LDAuMzIsMC4zMTEsMC4zMTEsMC4yNzcsMC40NjQsMC4zNiwwLjQyNywwLjE3OSwwLjU2OCwwLjQ3MSwwLjY0MywwLjQxNywwLjI5MywwLjUwNCwwLjQ3OSwwLjM1NiwwLjU5OCwwLjcxMywwLjU3OCwwLjM0NywxLDAuNjk4LDAuNTg1LDAuNDkzLDAuNTI5LDAuMzg5LDAuNDE3LDAuMjU3LDAuMzE2LDAuMzgyLDAuNDM3LDAuMzc1LDAuNDEsMC4zMTQsMC4yNSwwLjMxMSwwLjM1NywwLjI4OSwwLjI3OSwwLjQzNCwwLjMwMSwwLjUyMiwwLjM3NSwwLjQ2OSwwLjM2NiwwLjUxNSwwLjMyMiwwLjQ1NCwwLjQyNiwwLjM4MywwLjUzNywwLjE2MSwwLjU3NSwwLjU4NSwwLjY3MiwwLjU1OCwwLjc2MywwLjg4MiwwLjUzOSwwLjI0MywwLjc1OCwwLjgwNSwwLjUwOSwwLjU2OCwwLjU1MiwwLjYwOCwwLjQxOSwwLjQzMSwwLjM1NywwLjc4LDAuNTM1LDAuNjc0LDAuNDYzLDAuNTE5LDAuNDY3LDAuNjYzLDAuODI2LDAuNzQxLDAuNzg5LDAuNjg1LDAuNzAyLDAuNTQ1LDAuNjU2LDAuNDE4LDAuNDYyLDAuNDA4XQ==";ay.slug=aB;ay.authorslug=E;aC.type=a;aC.feature=b;aC.format=d;aC.location=O;aC.audioURL="https:\u002F\u002Fwww.podtrac.com\u002Fpts\u002Fredirect.mp3\u002Faudio.wnyc.org\u002Fradiorookies\u002Fradiorookies101320_youngrepublican.mp3";aC.title=aD;aC.author=w;aC.date="10\u002F15\u002F20";aC.featureImage="articles\u002FGettyImages-1156190019-edit.jpg";aC.featureImageSmall="articles\u002FGettyImages-1156190019-edit-small.jpg";aC.featureImageCaption="Young supporters of the US president attend a \"Make America Great Again\" rally at Minges Coliseum in Greenville, North Carolina, on July 17, 2019.";aC.featureImageCredits="Photo: NICHOLAS KAMM\u002FAFP via Getty Images";aC.summary="William Carter has been involved in politics since he was young, and he’s trying to find his way as a young Republican.

I’m the online editor and a reporter at Minero Magazine, a bilingual publication at the University of Texas at El Paso. Our newsroom recently switched to inclusive language. The change came about accidentally, when I turned in a story using non-gendered words, inserting an “x” whenever a gender-assuming article or modifier was used. The magazine’s leadership made the decision to make inclusive language the new standard. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“There have been various efforts to make Spanish more inclusive,” said Grecia Sanchez, who was Editor-in-Chief of Minero Magazine at the time. “First, the ‘@’ was used, instead of todos\u002Ftodas, tod@s was used. After that came the ‘x.’ The problem with these morphemes is that you can’t pronounce them. You can’t use that orally. Simply, ‘e’ is the one being used to satisfy the oral aspect of the change. And that’s the only difference. They have the same purpose, of including and to conceive of the existence of non-binary people and other identities in the Spanish language.” \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThese changes have major implications for political reporting. We make space for people that language had been excluding, even if that goes against the style guidelines of the Associated Press. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“For Minero, it is huge,” Sanchez said. “It’s not only that we’re making sure that reporters ask for people’s pronouns, but also that the commitment, at least for Minero, goes beyond bilingualism now. It’s more of respecting people’s identities and making sure they are represented in the media, in their stories, and accurately represented in what they talked about when doing interviews with us.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMaria Ramos is the new Editor-in-Chief at Minero who took over leadership of the magazine this academic year. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“So right now above all else, the most important thing is respecting who a person is, what they are feeling, and how they feel, how they want to be represented,” said Ramos.

All I knew was that there were Republicans and Democrats. My first memory of being politically aware was when I was 10 years old. It was during the Bush\u002FKerry presidential election and I found out that the vice president had a lesbian daughter but didn’t support gay marriage. I told all of my friends it was wrong to be so hypocritical. When I think about it, that was the beginning of me questioning the role of government in people’s lives. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI grew up as an only child in rural Pennsylvania with a single mom battling addiction, while my dad tried to raise me over the phone from 2,000 miles away. He sent child support each month but it went straight to my mom’s drinking funds. We only ate when food stamps were distributed, the roof over my head was a part of Section 8, and school lunches were my only guaranteed meal. But I never thought about who was behind these programs until my junior year of high school when my friend Amy told me to check out the Libertarian Party website. Reading their party platform, my main reaction was just “Wow, this makes sense.” I already agreed with their stance on social issues, such as criminal justice reform and immigration. I began to understand that capitalism isn’t evil and that my ability to exit poverty was tied directly to the ability to work.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI started to realize my life as a child had been dictated by our local and federal government. They give you just enough to stay alive and if you get a job and earn too much money, disability goes away and rent increases. My dad’s girlfriend Laynie and I spoke recently about my childhood and my politics. “I know you feel like the Democratic Party has kept your mother where she’s at. And the Republican Party is for the rich people, which wasn’t something any of us ever had. So with those two options, I can see where you would go Libertarian. You were looking for something that would help people, not just keep them — in your opinion — where they’re at.”  \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMy mom told me when she finally won her disability case that she couldn’t get a job if she wanted to keep those benefits. And what my mom had heard from her friends about libertarianism was what most people are often told: we’re greedy capitalists who don’t want to support the least vulnerable. I asked my mom what she thought when she heard that from her friend and she told me it scared her that someone might take away her benefits. But I would never advocate for something I thought would make my mom’s life more difficult. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt’s hard to explain to my mom how libertarianism works and why I think it could make life better, even for the most vulnerable.

But in this particular election, there is no way I can vote third party.”  But I don’t feel that I have to choose between the “lesser of two evils.” \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMy friend Kyle Mack is an independent who also tends to vote third party, “I think there’s often this view of independents as they’re kind of just like lazy voters that just haven’t put in the time to figure out what team their on, so they’re kind of wishy washy with their vote.

This administration was one of divisiveness, or one that was very polarizing. But election night was filled with guesses of the “Latino” vote and the “Black” vote. Rick Scott was on ABC mentioning the Castros and how that impacted Florida and the “Hispanic” vote. Arizona was a huge shock and it seems like Pima and Maricopa counties were critical to that upset and those are large Latinx communities, Maricopa being where this administration started its tenure by pardoning a man for committing essentially war crimes.

I don’t think many young voters were excited about a Biden\u002FHarris ticket. It was just a neutral against an evil. But nobody close to our age group or with our ideals was taken seriously in this process. Definitely excited about Omar Ilhan and the prospect of playing “Among Us” with Alexandria Ocasio Cortez as her political career continues. Young people don’t feel taken into consideration; they’re just not going to wait anymore to be given a seat at the table when the house is on fire. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"w-100 w-50-ns ph3-ns fr cb center f7 gray\"\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" class=\"db mw5 lazyload\" src=\"profiles\u002F5_Sher-Delva.jpg\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003ESher Delva, 28\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003EBoynton Beach, Florida \u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EMember of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) and poet\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDid you vote?  \u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI did vote in this election, and I voted Democrat.

There has been a significant amount of hints given by President Trump that indicate he will not handle the results of the election well if he is not the winner. I am fearing the reaction of the election. If Trump were to win, I’d fear for my rights as a woman.  After Amy Coney Barrett was sworn in, I started to fear my rights to my body when it comes to access to an abortion or birth control. In addition, during this election week, I really wanted Amendment 2 here in Florida to pass to increase the minimum wage to $15\u002Fhour. I am happy that we have heard the news of the amendment being passed. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EWhat are you seeing\u002Fhearing in your community? \u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn my community, there is a lot of uncertainty.  People do not know what will happen after a winner is announced.  It could be violent or the results could be disputed.  People are anxious.  Many of my friends are not sleeping, and feel the weight of what potentially is to come.  I think people are really realizing how divided the country is.  People are either on one side or another, and it is a very divisive spectrum. There is a severe lack of unity, and there is a lot of anger and panic. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ELooking ahead, what do you imagine will be the top issues in the months to come? \u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the month ahead, I think the pandemic will remain a top concern. The question remains whether restrictions on businesses will continue or if masks will continue to be mandated.  Small businesses have suffered tremendously.  I know several small businesses that have shut down due to financial loss related to strict guidelines related to the pandemic. At the same time, I know people who have died because of catching the virus. Both are serious concerns, so I think we will continue to grapple with the best way to move forward until numbers decline or a vaccine is approved. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDo you think young people feel represented in the political process?\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor the most part, I think young people feel they could be represented more. However, I am so proud of my DSA team for marching, canvassing and phone banking on behalf of Amendment 2.  I marched alongside several members of millennials and Gen Z DSA members, and the passing of Amendment 2 proved we were able to have an impact. It was a close vote, and I think our efforts helped raise awareness of the amendment and motivated people to vote for it.  I felt emotional when I saw the amendment pass because my mind instantly flashed to those who have to work multiple jobs to make ends meet. I thought of them, and how they will finally be on their way to making a more livable wage. The Florida minimum wage has not kept up with inflation, and the cost of living is astronomical. Gradually raising the minimum wage to 15\u002Fhr was absolutely necessary to keep up with the cost of living. The passing of the amendment highlighted how elections are more than just voting Democrat or voting for presidents, there are many amendments and local issues that have a huge impact on our daily lives. I hope people realize the power of paying attention to these issues and voting in more elections. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"w-100 w-50-ns ph3-ns fr cb center f7 gray\"\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" class=\"db mw5 lazyload\" src=\"profiles\u002F9_Erianna-Jiles.jpg\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003EErianna Jiles, 22\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003ESt Paul, MN \u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003ECreative writing student at Metropolitan State University\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDid you vote?

And Trump will just go down as being \"Trump.\" Either way it goes, either party will have to make some serious decisions about the health of the country (tackling COVID-19) and this continuous race war we can't seem to get over.

Living in a community where the wounds of racism are still very much open and festering, I'm hoping Biden and Harris will be elected and that they'll stick to their word and address systemic racism through police reform and other policies. I'm also very excited about the prospect of having a woman as vice president. I didn't realize how much this excited me until I felt a pit in my stomach watching Trump overtake Biden in North Carolina on Tuesday night, though it's still too close to call. I feel less anxious knowing that, at the very least, Democrat Roy Cooper won the election for governor in North Carolina, since he's committed to acknowledging climate change, strengthening the responses of coastal communities, and addressing harms done to large numbers of low-income communities of color.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EWhat are you seeing\u002Fhearing in your community? \u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI live in the largest county in North Carolina to go red in 2016, but this year, New Hanover County went blue by a small margin (he won by 50.08%).

I was on the bus on my way to work. The 4th day of waiting for my fate. As a young adult with DACA, my future was tied to this election – I had so much riding on it. I immediately began texting every one of my closest friends. But it wasn’t until later in the day that the news hit me, when I got messages from friends telling me to “ride the good energy.” It may sound cliché, but it really felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. The anxiety felt by the nation has been one that has been felt especially by people like me, people who are part of marginalized communities. The defeat of Donald Trump meant life or death to those communities that his administration willfully ignored or actively tried to pursue.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI was out in the neighborhoods of San Francisco in the celebrations. And I wore my mask, but I wanted to revel with the big crowds in the city and celebrate with the communities that I grew to feel a part of — the LGBTQ+ district in the Castro, the Latinx community in the Mission. Despite the COVID restrictions, it almost felt like everyone needed a win in 2020 and we were willing to risk it to rejoice in the moment.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI talked to my sisters shortly after the news and my first thought was that my sister Eva would finally be able to renew her DACA without fear of it being denied or being put into deportation proceedings. I immediately thought of other undocumented immigrants who, with a Biden administration, have renewed hope that once and for all, we’ll achieve citizenship for all. According to Joe Biden’s campaign website — which of course I’ve been checking and refreshing —he plans to work with Congress “\u003Ca class=\"link blue underline underline-hover hover-dark-red\" href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fjoebiden.com\u002Fimmigration\u002F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Ekeeping families together by providing a roadmap to citizenship for nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants.”\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is my hope that in the coming years, we begin to see the Biden-Harris administration do just that, with the support of Congress. But immigration is not the only issue I’m watching. It is clear that we are headed towards a climate crisis and with Biden promising to re-enlist the United States into the Paris climate accord, I only hope to see the U.S. take climate change seriously after all the warning signs so many of us have lived through.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI have SO many hopes for the next four years. It is renewed hope that the past four had managed to break down and smash into little pieces. Now, with the renewed spirit of activism across the country, we must continue to push for the change we want, no matter who’s in office.

When I thought about hurricanes, I almost always focused on resilience: our ability to piece our cities and towns back together with tarp brigades, chainsaw crews, and mass cleanup efforts. Then, through my work as a freelance journalist, I learned how certain coastal communities would be unlivable in a number of years. I started linking the stories I was documenting to flood zones, increases in flooding insurance, and socioeconomic inequities. And I began to understand that rising water temperatures in the Atlantic had an impact on multiple aspects of my own life, like the cost of my monthly rent. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI moved back home after college because I wanted to be close to my family, to the southeastern coast I'd come to know and love during my childhood. And I naively thought apartments would be affordable. After all, it wasn’t New York or Los Angeles. But I found myself scouring Zillow and Facebook Marketplace for apartments that fit my budget and that would be comfortable. I saw one-bedrooms with no washer-dryer priced near $1,000, and two-bedrooms in poor condition priced even higher. That might seem reasonable, depending on where you live, but the minimum wage in North Carolina is stuck at $7.50 and I was making about $1,800 a month. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI was working as a server at a breakfast diner, but the job I hoped to eventually pursue full-time was my gig in audio production at a local media platform, \u003Ca class=\"link blue underline underline-hover hover-dark-red\" href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fshoresides.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EShoresides\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.

I remember sitting on the porches of gutted houses in Pender County, listening to a grandmother talk about her waterlogged family photographs, FEMA trailer and financial losses. I profiled survivors in several rural, coastal counties who were waiting upwards of 18 months to get back into their homes. People I interviewed struggled to find affordable rentals while their homes were rebuilt. Their situations were obviously much more extreme than mine, but \u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003Eit didn’t occur to me that our trouble finding affordable housing was actually connected. Hurricanes and flooding have pushed up rents in coastal North Carolina. \u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHousing advocate Bri Mellott, a member of New Hanover Tenants’ Union, recently told me that after Hurricane Florence, landlords “either immediately uprooted everyone living [in affordable housing units] or allowed the properties to molder into non livability and blamed renters for the damage without fixing it until tenants left or were evicted.” National news sources have drawn these connections explicitly, but local mainstream media here in Wilmington typically tackle the topics as separate issues. I wondered why, locally, people weren’t generally asking the hard questions I’d started to think about.\nAdam Wagner, a reporter for The News and Observer who covers the effects of hurricanes, says it’s hard to decide when to include the connection to climate change and when to leave it out, because every story relates to climate change in some way. He says the impact of climate change is small for each individual hurricane, and sometimes he doesn’t feel it’s worth including in every story about storms and their damage to communities and homes. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“In too many small details, the point gets lost. Too much noise.” Wagner added that climate change made Hurricane Florence only 4% wetter, and he didn’t know if this would be a meaningful number to his readers. Sometimes Wagner and other reporters will give a nod to the crisis in their reporting rather than stating the link outright, “I think that there is a way to address climate change in a story that isn't ostensibly about climate change … this sort of mentality of, ‘Oh, it's just a graph or two somewhere in the story’ … but I'm not sure if it's enough.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then there’s the politics of my region. New Hanover County swings back and forth — in 2016 it went red for Trump, but so far this year, it’s leaning blue for Biden in the 98% of votes counted so far. However, Republicans maintain control of the House and Senate in North Carolina, as they have \u003Ca class=\"link blue underline underline-hover hover-dark-red\" href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newsobserver.com\u002Fnews\u002Fpolitics-government\u002Felection\u002Farticle246776737.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Esince 2010\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.

But he doesn’t push the issue of climate change publicly.  “As a housing advocate, I would probably avoid the topic because I don't want to piss somebody off who thinks climate change isn’t real,” he said. “I would rather try and get their support for things that I know need to be done.” Instead, he’s focusing on fights he thinks he can win, like creating affordable local rental and homeownership opportunities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDespite the rising cost of housing in Wilmington and continued impacts from seasonal hurricanes, the population has increased about 19% over the past 10 years. But even as each major hurricane in the area depletes our affordable housing stock, many people turn a blind eye to the coming storms and what they might mean for our city’s existence. After Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans residents who returned to the city either found their rents were higher or their low-income housing had turned to mixed-income apartments and condos. People were displaced both from and within their city.  \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have to think beyond tarp brigades and chainsaw crews. I wonder if we will make collective, meaningful connections between climate change and its impacts on our daily lives, like the rising cost of housing, regardless of whether or not there’s a storm brewing on the horizon. We must make this transition to honestly assess our future as coastal communities, to prevent and prepare rather than simply respond. We have to deal with our shrinking stock of affordable housing and address barriers to home ownership. By wrestling with the facts, we might have a fighting chance to address the global climate disaster that’s already changing our coastal cities. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs someone who’s grown up in this region and reported on its hurricanes, I took a long time to face these realities myself; I was scared to admit the worst case scenario might be real.

Because I know what the future might hold, and I am working as a citizen and a journalist to make lifestyle changes and collaborate on telling meaningful stories so we can see what’s happening all around us.

But the reality is, having a new president doesn’t 100 percent relieve me. If anything, it heightens my experience — making the burden of being Black in America a continuum. On the one hand, it’s a good time to express how I feel because suddenly everyone is “listening.” But on the other hand, I still walk around in the skin that I’m in and don’t get everything I need from society. It’s a weird trade-off.\nWhich makes it hard for me to easily accept change in the first place. But what’s my alternative? I don’t want to be angry all the time. And change is change, right?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHere are some things that do give me hope: \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERepresentation:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E The first thing I look forward to in this new administration is Vice President Kamala Harris. As a young, Black woman, I am very excited to see a woman and woman of color represented in our country’s highest levels of politics. Though Harris carries multiple identities, I can relate to her and put my faith in her judgment and her ability to push Biden outside of his comfort zone on hard issues. Because, I’ll be honest, it hurts my feelings to see myself and our country under the control of another white man.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ENew awareness:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E The last four years have broken our moral compass. We’ve lost that. People have started to wake up, though especially in Minnesota where I live. Here in the Midwest, it’s as if people thought racism only existed in the South or in the news until now. The conversation has started, but this administration needs to keep it going and call things out.  \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ESome COVID relief:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E We are almost at our one year pandemic anniversary and people are still dying across the world and our country. In the first 100 days, I would like to see vaccines being pushed out, without all the chaos. Nobody seems to know what to do. I want this next administration to get a handle on things. And I really just want to stop getting notifications about how many new COVID cases there are everyday. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI’m also thinking about myself in this moment. I can wish for all these things to happen in the new administration, but I still need to do my part. How can I be a part of making change happen within my own capacities?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith our country in an uproar and in such a divided state, it has become much harder to tap in academically as a student finishing up college, and find the joys in being an educated person in the world. But I see, in times like these, the more educated folk, the better. The misinformation surrounding politics is ruining us. Just look at social media.  \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I’m going to stay informed, try to have honest conversations when divisions come up in my own life, and I’m going to give Biden and Harris the benefit of the doubt that they can remake America in a way that might help me.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut I know it’s going to take more than trust and faith that “everything will work out,” to make me feel a part of this country again.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E";bf.slug=bh;bf.authorslug=k;bi.type=a;bi.feature=b;bi.format=c;bi.location="Athens, GA";bi.title=bj;bi.author=w;bi.date=J;bi.featureImage="articles\u002F_President-Elect-Joe-Biden-And-Vice-President-Elect-Kamala-Harris-Address-The-Nation-After-Election-Win.jpg";bi.featureImageSmall="articles\u002F_President-Elect-Joe-Biden-And-Vice-President-Elect-Kamala-Harris-Address-The-Nation-After-Election-Win_small.jpg";bi.featureImageCaption=bk;bi.featureImageCredits=bl;bi.summary="A young Republican is ready for the end of the Trump era but holding on to his conservative beliefs.";bi.text="\u003Cp\u003EAs a young voter I have often thought about my place in the world over the past year. First it was the pandemic, then questioning what it means to be a Republican. Working on campaigns since I was a child, I never thought the day would come where I would seriously consider closing the door on politics. It is a long story, but I was sucker-punched like so many others last year, and the combination of intense politics, the world gone mad and all the other things that go along with young adulthood, my health and well-being were on the line.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow is a time where I find myself looking towards the future with hope, but also apprehension.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA few months ago I would have never thought I would have thrown away my support of President Trump. Then, imagine being a Georgian, where I’m from. We had to endure another two months of elections, and blistering attacks from the president against our elected officials, not to mention the constant attack ads — I couldn’t watch “Family Guy” without being reminded every five minutes that David Perdue is a thief, Kelly Loeffler is corrupt, Jon Ossoff is a liar, or Raphael Warnock is dangerous. Then the Capitol riots occurred. That entire day was a travesty and a stain on America and the principles she stands for.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt surely can’t be a surprise that after all of this, I decided to no longer support Trump, while remaining a committed Republican and conservative.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn Facebook, I was attacked maliciously for this decision. I received threats, I was told that I have no character, I’m not a patriot. I was inundated with profanities, and many friendships that I had for years subsequently ended after a 100-word post where I stood up for the principles that I believed in.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo here I am now, with less friends, but my faith in the democratic process remains strong. I didn’t vote for them, but one thing is clear to me: Joseph Biden and Kamala Harris are the rightfully elected president and vice president of the United States. I just hope they don’t give in to far-left principles and remain moderates. Because realistically, in this day and age, that’s the only way we’ll get things done. Republicans have work to do also to end the Trump era. As for me, I’m taking a break, at least until 2022, and my Facebook page calms down.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERight now, I don’t have a lot of confidence in the future but I know that will change, and I wish the Biden administration luck healing the wounds of our fractured country.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E";bi.slug=bm;bi.authorslug=x;bn.type=a;bn.feature=b;bn.format=c;bn.location=f;bn.title=bo;bn.author=g;bn.date=J;bn.featureImage="articles\u002Ffeatureimage_sher.jpg";bn.featureImageSmall="articles\u002Ffeatureimage_sher_small.jpg";bn.featureImageCaption=bk;bn.featureImageCredits=bl;bn.summary="18-to-29 Now and 18by.vote hosted a town hall discussion for young people to reflect on the 2020 election cycle";bn.text="\u003Cp\u003EIn the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, 13 young people from across the nation set out to document our lives during one of the most politically charged eras in recent history. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile meeting virtually over the course of 10 months, our team members — of different genders, backgrounds, ethnicities and political views — documented our communities and shared our perspectives.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe interviewed our families, friends and neighbors and reported on how the political climate impacted where we live. For some of us, our political beliefs were amplified through the experience. For others, they transformed altogether. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe heard from William Carter, a Republican who was grappling with the GOP establishment’s inability to relinquish power and let young Republican voices be heard. We also heard from Juan Mireles-Palomar, an undocumented youth anxiously living in limbo after Trump’s rhetoric threatened DACA, and from Kaleigh Cunningham, a third party voter fed up with the two-party system altogether. \nBut the project expanded far beyond electoral politics. From virtual graduations to struggling to choose the best college to attend during a global health crisis, each story illuminated an on-the-ground view of young adults seeking stability while enduring months of continuous uncertainty. Ultimately, we shared the hope for change to come as the election approached.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, the election revealed young voters have a huge impact. Millennials and Gen Z make up 37 percent of the eligible voting population — and our presence was felt in the 2020 election. Fifty-two to 55 percent of youth voted in the 2020 election, according to \u003Ca class=\"link blue underline underline-hover hover-dark-red\" href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcircle.tufts.edu\u002Flatest-research\u002Felection-week-2020\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ECIRCLE\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, and impacted results in many key battleground states, helping Joe Biden secure the presidency.\nStill, numbers only tell so much. To gain deeper insight, 18-to-29 Now teamed up with 18by.vote — an organization that aims to help teenagers understand the voting process — to host a town hall and find out how young people really feel about their political influence. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe event, led by me, \u003Ca class=\"link blue underline underline-hover hover-dark-red\" href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002FSherDelva\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ESher Delva\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, and \u003Ca class=\"link blue underline underline-hover hover-dark-red\" href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002FJazminLKay\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EJazmin Kay\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, resulted in conversations that were both unexpected and insightful. Here are some excerpts from the conversation, edited for length and clarity, that highlight different perspectives:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EOn climate change:\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E“If I had it my way, the Republican Party would be dealing with climate change — and I want them to. But the problem is they’re just stuck in their old ways. And I think college students, and young people in general, are going to become the major voting block. If they didn't in this election, then certainly the next election. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd when it comes to those issues, eventually we're going to have people take office, whether as a Republican or as a Democrat, that would be more — in my hope — moderate. Not so far to the right and so far to the left. If we can do something like that, I feel like we’ll actually get the changes that we want.” – William Carter, 23\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EOn the importance of representation:\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E“Representation obviously is vital in times like this. [One of my friends] did not choose to vote. He was just like, ‘I don't relate to them. I don't relate to these two white candidates.’ And I know a lot of people in the Black community feel more represented with Kamala there. Just simply just because she’s a woman of color. I think that a lot of people don’t feel connected to these people that are running. And that’s kind of why a lot of people don't vote … I don’t think that we’re ever going to have the correct person or the person who is going to be the most perfect. But I do think representation matters.” – Erianna Jiles, 22\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EOn encouraging voting: \u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E“When it got to the point that Biden was obviously going to be the candidate, I think people started feeling really defeated and talking about how Biden sucks and just being overall negative about it. I tried to get out of that mindset a little because even though he's not necessarily our top choice, it was really important to me that we were still finding a way to stay positive. Because if you’re not staying positive, you’re going to be less likely to go to the polls when election day comes. You’re not going to be able to empower other people to vote as much. So even if you plan to vote and you’re going around complaining about the candidates that you’re voting for, it's not as realistic to expect people to buy into your message of: Go vote at the polls.” – Dora Segall, 22\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EOn the role of the media:\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E“I have a really hard time sometimes because sometimes I hear about things in social media that aren’t reported in mainstream media. I learn more through Instagram about the Black Lives Matter movement than I do in mainstream media. But then if I go down certain Twitter and Instagram holes, I’m not going to learn something. So, it’s like, sometimes I feel like the media do not necessarily always represent things that are going on or they’re left-leaning or right-leaning.” – Laura Bratton, 23\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“I wish that the media did a better job of just uplifting the narratives of American voters who aren’t considered to be authorities or experts, but are the ones who are in the polling place.” – Dora Segall, 22\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EOn the ‘Latinx vote’:\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E“What I saw a lot in the pieces that I put out was definitely this amalgamation of how everything that’s being talked about by politicians is so much more than just talking points — it may be that for them, but for people who actually have to go out and vote, it's something that affects us, these different issues. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI was covering a lot of the Latinx voting block, but that’s such a huge misnomer. How do you really group up the entire ‘Hispanic vote?’\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI think we all know that the younger generation … is not oblivious. We know what we’re talking about. We know what these issues are, but we seem to never really be taken into account. That’s especially true with the Latinx vote. Every Latinx vote is vastly different but no one is trying to reach directly to us. That’s an issue that we’re seeing is how this political process is excluding a lot of people.” – Antonio Villaseñor-Baca, 24\u003C\u002Fp\u003E";bn.slug=bp;bn.authorslug=h;return {data:[{slug:e,article:K,biosData:L,authordata:Q,readMoreArticles:[_,aa,ac,af,ai,al,ap,as,av,ay,aC,aF,aI,aL,aP,aU,aX,a_,bd,bf,bi,bn],articleData:{stories:[_,aa,ac,af,ai,K,al,ap,as,av,ay,aC,aF,aI,aL,aP,aU,aX,a_,bd,bf,bi,bn],main:{type:"about",featured:[{title:bg,slug:bh},{title:bj,slug:bm}],latest:[{title:bo,slug:bp},{title:"Connecting The Dots On Climate Change and The Cost Of Rent",slug:be},{title:ba,slug:bc},{title:aY,slug:aZ},{title:aV,slug:aW},{title:aQ,slug:aT},{title:aG,slug:aH},{title:"A Democratic Socialist on Election 2020: \"I’ll vote for Biden but I want more for the country",slug_custom:e,slug:e},{title:aJ,slug:aK},{title:aN,slug:aO},{title:aD,slug:aE},{title:az,slug:aB},{title:ad,slug:ae},{title:aw,slug:ax},{title:"Barely Making It: Navigating 2020 as a Broke College Student",slug:ab},{title:aj,slug:ak},{title:aq,slug:ar},{title:ag,slug:ah},{title:at,slug:au},{title:am,slug:ao},{title:"I’m Conservative and COVID-19 Brings Conflicts of Political Interest",slug:$}],quotes:[{quote:"“We are individual voices that form a collective voice for our younger generation at this moment.”",author:"Juan Mireles Palomar",location:a$,authorslug:q},{quote:"“Because of the Black Lives Matter movement, I feel the most optimistic I've ever been about the future of the country.\"",author:U,location:V,authorslug:W},{quote:"“It’s time to show that young people are paying attention, getting active, and making an impact that will last generations.”",author:y,location:z,authorslug:A},{quote:"\"From the pandemic to the fight for equality, we have to monitor the factors that are contributing to a lot of the issues youth face today.\"",author:g,location:f,authorslug:h},{quote:"“We are carving our own path forward because the old rules of American success have stopped applying.”",author:C,location:D,authorslug:E},{quote:"“The youth right now are coming of age into a system in a standstill and now they want change.
