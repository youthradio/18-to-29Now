What happens when you don't have the answers?","text":"<p>When COVID-19 arrived in the United States, it brought so many questions with it. Scary questions. Questions about our jobs and our social networks and our collective well-being.</p>\n<p>But for me, it also brought hard ideological questions. COVID-19 forced me to ask myself, “How do I reconcile my political ideology with what is going on all around me?”</p>\n<p>I identify as a conservative-libertarian, a conservatarian for short. I joke that when I am around my conservative friends I am shocked by what they want the government to be doing, and when I am around my libertarian friends I am shocked by what they do not want the government to be doing. If I had to summarize my political beliefs, I just want limited and fiscally responsible government, empowered individuals and justice and liberty for all.</p>\n<p>There is one very big difference that separates this cultural moment from those before it: I have no context or previous framework to help me figure things out. Where I live in Iowa, many businesses are still closed (even as other parts of the state slowly reopen) and I keep reading about federal spending going up and up. While I’m concerned about the huge deficit numbers and civil liberties, my first pandemic is a whole new ballgame and I’m lacking arguments and solutions that only come with prior experience.</p>\n<p>The dichotomy between my political views and the response to COVID-19 only becomes more apparent when I think about my loved ones. All of my immediate family members and many of my close friends have had their lives dramatically impacted by this pandemic in some way. And when I sit and listen to their experiences, any answers I have seem insufficient.</p>\n<p>My insufficient answers show themselves in my parents’ living room as we worry together about whether or not my father can remain self-employed in social media marketing and communications after this is over. They linger uncomfortably in the back of my head as I wait to hear back from my severely at-risk mother about whether or not she tested positive for COVID-19. They are still there when I drive my father to the emergency room myself after he starts showing symptoms weeks later.</p>\n<p>The insufficiency is obvious as I wonder when my little brother Morgan, temporarily laid off from his position at a local coffeeshop, will be able to go back to work. Is unemployment for the sake of public health preferable to ruining the financial livelihood of so many? What can be done here? What should be done here? But just when I think lockdown is the wrong answer to this issue, I talk to my sister Lily, a nursing student, who makes a case for why it should continue.</p>\n<p>Insufficient answers are right there with me as I talk with her what is happening in the hospital where she works. They are there as my heart breaks with her while she talks about changes on her hospice floor because of COVID-19: “My heart kind of broke because I had patients who were dying and they could only have two family members [present].”</p>\n<p>I feel the weight of my insufficient answers when I talk with my best friend J. as he runs himself ragged trying to ensure the health of the team he manages in a big box store that’s still open. We often agree politically and so the gravity of this situation hit even harder when he said, “It is really difficult because, from my political perspective, I don’t like to set precedents where the government can lock anything down that the private sector is doing. I want the private sector to be free from regulation. But, right now, the safety and public health of the entire state is very close in my mind to outweighing the dangers of the precedent that would be set…”</p>\n<p>The quest to figure out what I think in the midst of this pandemic is only complicated by the anti-shutdown rallies happening around the country. As I struggle alongside others with similar political beliefs to figure out what I think the solutions should be during this unprecedented time of hardship and heartache, I can’t help but notice we are underrepresented in the media. While many of us sit quietly and try to reason through this, we are represented by the loud and nominal few who shirk the responsibility we have to our communities in favor of being able to open up their cities and keep their summer vacation plans.</p>\n<p>So how do I reconcile my political ideology with what is going on around me? I have been wrestling with this question for weeks, only to come to the same conclusion every time: I don’t know. Maybe I’ll figure it out before all this is over, but I have a feeling that clear answers will only come in retrospect.</p>","slug":"im-conservative-and-covid-19-brings-conflicts-of-political-interest","authorslug":"kelvey-vander-hart"},{"type":"story","feature":"false","format":"video","location":"St. Paul, MN","videourl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDh-k0YZ-JE","videoid":"VDh-k0YZ-JE","title":"Barely Making It: Navigating 2020 As a Broke College Student","author":"Erianna Jiles","date":"06/02/20","featureImage":"articles/Erianna_Jiles2.jpg","featureImageSmall":"articles/Erianna_Jiles2-small.jpg","summary":"Erianna Jiles takes us through what it's like to be a college student trying to make it, and how the 2020 election could affect her and other first-generation students in the same situation.","text":"<p>Erianna Jiles takes us through what it's like to be a college student trying to make it, and how the 2020 election could affect her and other first-generation students in the same situation.</p>","slug":"barely-making-it-navigating-2020-as-a-broke-college-student","authorslug":"erianna-jiles"},{"type":"story","feature":"false","format":"audio","location":"St. Paul, MN","audioURL":"https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/radiorookies/radiorookies071320_eriannajiles.mp3","title":"A Minnesotan Weighs In: Is There Hope After the Hashtags?","author":"Erianna Jiles","date":"06/04/20","featureImage":"articles/AmemorialsiteGeorge-Floyd-edit.jpg","featureImageSmall":"articles/AmemorialsiteGeorge-Floyd-edit-small.jpg","featureImageCaption":"A memorial site where George Floyd died while in police custody in Minneapolis.","featureImageCredits":"Photo: Stephen Maturen/Getty Images.","summary":"The killing of George Floyd has led many people to consider what they and those around them think about race in America. Erianna Jiles has been frustrated, but encouraged that maybe we’re at a turning point.","text":"<p>I grew up in St. Paul, and as an African-American, I know there is racism here, but I rarely see it actively on display. In South Minneapolis, where George Floyd died, most of the people I’ve met are super liberal and white people who “care.” The murder happening in this neighborhood, makes me question the Minnesota I know. </p>\n<p>The image of Derek Chauvin’s knee on Floyd’s neck keeps replaying in my head. To me, it represents a metaphor for the experiences that African-Americans face daily. Some days I feel like I can’t breathe because it’s hard for Black people in this country to catch a break — from racism, police brutality and COVID-19. I don’t understand why just our existence often seems threatening.</p>\n<p>Since Floyd’s death, I’ve felt anxious and exhausted. I’ve just had to take a break. It’s too much pressure to deal with my emotions while social media is flooded with opinions from so many people.  </p>\n<p>At 22 years old, I know that to see real change in this country, we need all people that don’t look like me to stand up. The response to Floyd’s death feels more inclusive, but it’s deeper than showing up to protests with your “Black Lives Matter” sign.</p>\n<p> What will life look like when the protests end and the hashtags disappear? Will you still be our voice to challenge injustice? Will you urge officers to abide by their oaths and finally protect people that look like me?</p>\n<p>These last few weeks have left me questioning my four white roommates. Since the incident, I haven’t heard a word from them. It’s confusing that they can attend rallies and stand up for Black lives but can’t check on the one Black person they share a house with. </p>\n<p>I understand this makes for uncomfortable conversations, but it is time. If we don’t start this dialogue, we’ll continue with a generation of police officers like Chauvin or the many Amy Coopers of our society who don’t understand *why *reporting fake crimes against Black people can be deadly. </p>\n<p>I have hope we might be at a crossroads for change. So I’m committed to talking to my white friends, peers and now my roommates about how we can create a better understanding of one another and bridge the gap. </p>\n<p>In return, all I ask is that white people engage themselves in conversations, be open-minded to hearing experiences they’ve never had before and not ignore the signs of racism just because it’s easier at the moment. </p>\n<p>Ultimately, I can only hope for a society that treats me like my life matters. </p>\n<p><i>Also featured on NPR/WBUR’s <a class=\"link blue underline underline-hover hover-dark-red\" href=\"https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Here and Now</a>.</i></p>","audioWaveform":"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","slug":"a-minnesotan-weighs-in-is-there-hope-after-the-hashtags","authorslug":"erianna-jiles"},{"type":"story","feature":"false","format":"audio","location":"Stockton and San Francisco, CA.","audioURL":"https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/radiorookies/radiorookies071320_juanmireles.mp3","title":"Life in Legal Limbo: A Dreamer Reflects","author":"Juan Mireles-Palomar","date":"06/04/20","featureImage":"articles/juan_life-in-legal-limbo_feature-edit.jpg","featureImageSmall":"articles/juan_life-in-legal-limbo_feature-edit-small.jpg","featureImageCaption":"Juan Mireles-Palomar with his father and sister.","featureImageCredits":"Photo: Courtesy of Juan Mireles-Palomar.","summary":"Juan Mireles-Palomar has to navigate the politicized nature of his immigration status. He gets into the conflicting feelings he has about how his legal status plays a role in his future — and his sister's.","text":"<p><b>Juan:</b> [Talking on telephone] How’s my mom?</p>\n<p><b>Eva:</b> [Talking on telephone] She’s doing good. I went to her house the other day. Have you talked to her? </p>\n<p><b>Juan:</b> This is my older sister Eva. She is someone I have always looked up to because she is a badass, resilient, and like my favorite Powerpuff girl, Buttercup. The green one. </p>\n<p><b>Juan:</b> [Talking on telephone] Yeah, she FaceTimed me and showed me her new house.</p>\n<p><b>Eva:</b> [Talking on telephone] I know, I’ve seen it. I went over last week or two weeks ago. It’s hecka cute. Her kitchen is hecka big and Sofi has her own room. She was running around showing me her room and showing me all of her stuff.</p>\n<p><b>Juan:</b> [Talking on telephone] Oh, I miss Sofi. She’s so cute…</p>\n<p><b>Juan:</b> When we were little, Eva and I would play all day outside until the sun came down. We both loved Rihanna, had the same taste in ice cream. In many ways we were the same, except for our legal status, which divided us. I was undocumented, while she had papers, which meant she had access to opportunities that I didn’t. </p>\n<p>[Music plays]</p>\n<p><b>Juan:</b> In high school, the majority of my friends were already working and getting their driver’s licenses. But because of my legal status, I couldn’t. My sister Eva could though. She was a year older and she had first priority when it came to obtaining documentation. My parents paid for her to apply for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, but they couldn’t pay for both of us.</p>\n<p><b>Eva:</b> Oh, it made all of the difference, having DACA. Having that now meant that I can go and pursue my dreams, go to college, get a job, earn money for myself, make myself an independent person. That just meant everything. It was a life changer, you know. </p>\n<p><b>Juan:</b> That’s what I wanted too. But during my junior year of high school, my dad was unexpectedly deported back to Mexico. Without my dad around, my mom’s job at a flower nursery wasn’t enough to cover the bills and play for the DACA application of $495. Also, it was almost impossible for me to find a job without DACA. The only other option in Stockton, California was to go to work in the fields. So during my senior year, I got a job in a fruit packaging warehouse and I got paid under the table, like most undocumented field workers. </p>\n<p>[Music changes]</p>\n<p><b>Juan:</b> Everyday after school, I rush over to this big stuffy warehouse and start packaging cherries. I stand at the same spot for hours, trying to move my hands and open the bags faster than the cherries falling on the ground. I’m exhausted. And I’m thinking to myself, “Why is this my only option? Why can’t I just have a regular job like my friends or Eva? And can this damn machine slow down?!” </p>\n<p>Eventually the bell rings, notifying us it’s time to clock out. By now, It’s 1 a.m. I go home and start whatever homework I have due the next day. This was my routine my senior year. School. Work. Grieve for my dad in silence. Repeat. My goal was to save up for my DACA application, but the reality is most of the money went to help around the house. As my senior year was coming to an end, it became more urgent. I was scared I would have to put off college. But then I got a surprise.</p>\n<p><b>Juan:</b> [Paper crinkles] Here’s the note I got…”Sometimes the American Dream comes true … with a little help. Never stop dreaming. From: those who believe in you.”</p>\n<p><b>Juan:</b> As a graduation gift, my teachers pooled money together to pay the full amount of my DACA application. I was so overwhelmed with emotions, I couldn’t believe it! I turned in my application just before Trump’s election. It would take nearly a year until I finally received my official Employment Authorization Card. I finally had temporary legal status. I immediately applied for a job, opened a bank account, got my drivers license, saved up some money and moved out of my house to the city. </p>\n<p>All the things I wanted to do but couldn’t before getting DACA. I wanted to take full advantage of the opportunities I now had, or at least temporarily had. So I was able to find a job at a fashion boutique store and a place to live, I was able to buy my own bed and my own furniture. I was doing things all on my own. On the other hand, my sister? She let her DACA expire. She didn’t want to continue paying the money. We ended up on opposite paths again.</p>\n<p><b>Eva:</b> Now I’m looking at it like you’re so dumb. “You should have just paid the five hundred dollars.” It was so hard for me after that. I struggled more without it. [Back] then, I would have struggled without those five hundred dollars at the time. </p>\n<p><b>Juan:</b> She had to move back home, and lost some of the independence I admired in her. I got a taste of what my sister went through once the coronavirus pandemic hit. I was starting to feel comfortable in my new adult life when the governor ordered the closure of non-essential businesses. Clearly that meant my job at the boutique would close, and I was furloughed. The idea of losing my job scared me, and I figured I’d be back where I started. Then I learned that I would be eligible for unemployment benefits through the state of California, something my sister Eva can’t access because of her current status.</p>\n<p><b>Eva:</b> No government aid, no government funding, nothing because I’m not documented.</p>\n<p><b>Juan:</b> Despite her legal status, my sister is still working. She works at a restaurant in Stockton.</p>\n<p><b>Eva:</b> Luckily my work didn’t get shut down but I know other jobs did, a lot of other restaurants did. My hours have gotten cut about like five to six hours a week and now I need as much hours as I can. Because I just moved out but yeah, this thing has cut back on my hours. Coronavirus. [Laughs]</p>\n<p><b>Juan:</b> [Laughs] I totally feel that. They completely cut my hours.</p>\n<p><b>Eva:</b> I know, you lost your job! It’s crazy. That’s why I’m fortunate to have mine and I’m fortunate to have the hours that I do have and I’m just hoping for it to go back to normal because I want to work my full hours. </p>\n<p><b>Juan:</b> This lockdown is more than a matter of health for families like ours. It’s about whether or not there will be food on the table or even a place to live. If you are undocumented, you don’t qualify for the Federal CARES Act, which provides economic assistance for U.S. citizens. But in April, Governor Newsom announced his plan to get $75 million in statewide funds for immigrant families impacted by COVID-19. However, it’s not clear if my family will get any of those limited funds. So we still have reason to worry.</p>\n<p><b>Eva:</b> If I stopped working that would mean my income would completely stop. I would have no income at all. Because unlike citizens who lose their job and can go and sign up for unemployment and receive some money to help them, I can’t.</p>\n<p><b>Juan:</b> The truth is, even if both of us had DACA, my sister Eva and I are both still in limbo. This program for young immigrants like us has been debated in Congress and threats to end it are ongoing. While the Supreme Court upheld the program for now, it’s fate will probably depend on the next presidency — Trump or Biden. But for now, my sister and I have each other’s back no matter what, even though we still can’t decide on which Rihanna song is best.</p>\n<p><i>Also featured on <a class=\"link blue underline underline-hover hover-dark-red\" href=\"https://www.radiotopia.fm/podcasts/adult-ish\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Adult ISH podcast</a> distributed by Radiotopia.</i></p>","audioWaveform":"WzAuNzc0LDAuMjc2LDAuNTYxLDAuNDYyLDAuNjUxLDAuNTg3LDAuMzYyLDAuNzY5LDAuNjMsMC42MTUsMC40NzIsMC40MzEsMC40MjUsMC41ODUsMC41MjYsMC41ODUsMC41MiwwLjY3OSwwLjQ4OSwwLjQ4NCwwLjU1LDEsMC45NzEsMC44MjMsMC43NSwwLjU2NiwwLjQyNSwwLjU4NiwwLjQxOCwwLjUzNiwwLjY0NywwLjQ3NywwLjM0NiwwLjc2NSwwLjYzNiwwLjcsMC40NDUsMC42MjgsMC43NjIsMC40ODksMC41NTgsMC41NzcsMC4zODgsMC4zNzEsMC40MjEsMC40LDAuNTYyLDAuNDU5LDAuNTQ5LDAuNDQ3LDAuNDQyLDAuNTIyLDAuMjYzLDAuNjAxLDAuNzcsMC4zMzUsMC40NzYsMC40NzEsMC40MTQsMC40OTMsMC40NDIsMC40NDIsMC40ODIsMC4zODksMC41MjQsMC40ODYsMC41ODYsMC4zNjUsMC41MjcsMC40OTIsMC42NTMsMC41NDYsMC42MDMsMC40MTMsMC40NjksMC40NTUsMC40NzMsMC40NzMsMC4zMTYsMC41NDksMC40ODUsMC42MzgsMC40MDUsMC43MzEsMC45MTYsMC42MDUsMC41ODYsMC40NDUsMC40MTQsMC40OTQsMC42MDIsMC40NzcsMC40ODgsMC41NzgsMC40NzYsMC40ODIsMC40NjMsMC40NTMsMC40ODUsMC40NzYsMC41MzEsMC40NjIsMC40OTgsMC40MjEsMC4zMzUsMC41OTksMC42MDksMC44MjgsMC44MDYsMC4yMjhd","slug":"life-in-legal-limbo-a-dreamer-reflects","authorslug":"juan-mireles-palomar"},{"type":"story","feature":"false","format":"audio","location":"Boynton Beach, FL","audioURL":"https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/radiorookies/radiorookies071320_sherdelva.mp3","title":"To Move Forward After Bernie, A Young Progressive Looks To The Past","author":"Sher Delva","date":"06/04/20","featureImage":"articles/sher_young-progressive_feature-edit.jpg","featureImageSmall":"articles/sher_young-progressive_feature-edit-small.jpg","featureImageCaption":"Sher Delva poses for a photo with several other Bernie Sanders supporters during a debate watch party in January 2020.","featureImageCredits":"Photo: Courtesy of Sher Delva","summary":"Bernie Sanders' run for president may be over but the young people at the center of it are still politically engaged.

And I never did get that prom dress — I just wanted something to feel hopeful about.

Your dress, like, just came in the mail.</p>\n<p><b>Shayla:</b> I’m not too upset because at least it’s not cancelled. It’s just postponed. </p>\n<p><b>Madison:</b> I don’t know if you guys felt that but like yesterday, I don’t know why I was just in this state of, like — literally if we don’t have prom, it’s whatever. Like, I just couldn’t care less. I was so mad because, like, what have we actually had that was normal? What?</p>\n<p><b>Madison:</b> I think we all knew it wasn’t gonna happen. I was trying to convince myself I didn’t care. But my friends really wanted to do something.</p>\n<p><b>Madison:</b> You had a whole plan?</p>\n<p><b>Rayelle:</b> Yeah, if I heard that the prom was cancelled: The day I’m supposed to go to prom I’m wearing my dress, regardless where I am.</p>\n<p>[Madison laughs.]</p>\n<p><b>Rayelle:</b> Do the whole dress up. Hair, makeup, nails, everything. And I’m wearing the dress. I don’t care if I’m going grocery shopping.</p>\n<p><b>Shayla:</b> Go off. </p>\n<p><b>Madison:</b> So on the day our prom was scheduled for, my friends and I threw our own. </p>\n<p>[Madison greets friends.]</p>\n<p><b>Madison:</b> Hi</p>\n<p><b>Friend:</b> Oh my god, you look so pretty!</p>\n<p><b>Madison:</b> Thank you!</p>\n<p><b>Friend:</b> Go off, sis!</p>\n<p><b>Madison:</b> When I got to Shayla’s house I was really excited to see everyone.

That’s so cute.</p>\n<p><b>Second friend:</b> You tie-dyed it?</p>\n<p><b>Madison:</b> I wore an old dress — that I had dyed sunset colors that morning — and we stood on Shayla’s driveway posing for pictures.

And at first, I was excited to try recovery online.</p>\n<p>[<b>Laura:</b> Join without video]</p>\n<p><b>Laura:</b> Going to 12-step meetings in different parts of the world and hearing people’s stories while I’m eating dinner in my pajamas.</p>\n<p><b>Felicia:</b> Like in the beginning. I just want to get super spiritual.  </p>\n<p><b>Laura:</b> Felicia is a friend from my 12-step home group. </p>\n<p><b>Felicia:</b> You fast-forward like three weeks and I’m just sitting in my house doing puzzles.</p>\n<p><b>Laura:</b> I get it. Before COVID, I used to go to three or four 12-step meetings every week. But after a few weeks online, I went down to one. Other people started dropping off too. I figured some people just couldn’t adjust to getting their recovery on a computer screen. I helped Jim, a regular at my home group, figure out how to log onto a Zoom meeting — but he didn’t love it. </p>\n<p><b>Jim:</b> They’re just things you miss. The look in people’s eyes. The smiles on their faces.  </p>\n<p><b>Laura:</b>  I wondered if some people were slipping through the cracks. Had they relapsed? Were they okay? Like this one guy I know, Robert. I’ve known him for years. He’s in a court-ordered treatment program. And he was a regular in my home group before the pandemic started. Then a few weeks into shelter in place, I noticed he’d relapsed. He was starting over, counting sober days rather than months. I called him back in April to find out what happened. </p>\n<p><b>Robert:</b> I was riding my bike around town like nothing was open and there were no meetings going on. And I was really, really contemplating getting high. </p>\n<p><b>Laura:</b> Robert told me that almost all of his support systems shut down — court mandated therapy programs and drug tests that made him feel accountable. </p>\n<p><b>Robert:</b>  I didn’t want to blame my relapse on COVID-19 and I’m not going to. But I did think about it and, like, it gave me such a — it was such a big factor to like me starting to isolate again. I still had those people there. But not being able to physically be with them or see their smiles in person or feel their energy just took a lot from me I think.  </p>\n<p><b>Laura:</b> Why do you think those things are so important for you getting sober?  </p>\n<p><b>Robert:</b> Cause, I mean, I’m an addict, an alcoholic. But like at the end of the day, I’m a f-ing human. </p>\n<p><b>Laura:</b> That was April 16, one month into shelter in place. I didn’t see Robert in online meetings for the next week, and I worried what would happen to him. Right around that time, I also found out that a few people I knew from my early days in sobriety had overdosed and died. Weeks went by and I still didn’t see Robert. Then in May, a friend told me she’d seen his mugshot online. It turns out he’d gotten arrested. Right after he got out, I called him to see what happened.</p>\n<p><b>Robert:</b> Hey, what’s up? </p>\n<p><b>Laura:</b> How ya doin? </p>\n<p><b>Robert:</b> I’m alright. </p>\n<p><b>Laura:</b> He said the day after we’d talked, he’d gotten high again and called his probation officer. I asked him what went on during those three weeks he was in jail.</p>\n<p><b>Robert:</b> You’re locked in a cell for 23 hours a day, that’s their form of quarantine. That makes COVID like kind of seem easy. Like, I remember being out on rec one day and I saw this, I think it was like — what’s the insurance company that Flo works for? Progressive?</p>\n<p><b>Laura:</b> Progressive?</p>\n<p><b>Robert:</b> They had like some commercial where they were like all on like a Zoom meeting. And like, I looked at it and I was just like, you know, like I could be in a Zoom meeting right now.  </p>\n<p><b>Laura:</b> Robert’s been out of jail for more than a month. I’ve seen him in Zoom meetings, and I got a call from him a few weeks ago asking to join my home group. As a group, we’ve been waiting for months until we can all be together in person and finally, when phase two started, we made plans to meet on the beach.</p>\n<p>[<b>Laura:</b> I’m headed to my first home group meeting I've been to in person since COVID started. Yeah. I don't know what this is gonna be like at all.]</p>\n<p>[<b>Laura:</b> So I’m on my way back from the home group. I don’t know how I feel about it. Like, no one was wearing masks and I mean, people were kind of sitting six feet apart. But it feels like we were closer than that. It was like not a lot of people from my home group were there. I would say only me and two other people and then a bunch of people I just didn’t recognize. It definitely felt pretty of sparse. I’m actually passing the church where we usually have our home group right now — I don’t think they’ve been in that church for a long time. I definitely miss that place.]  </p>\n<p><b>Laura:</b> Here we are, phase two.  My home group stopped doing Zoom and we’re trying to figure out what’s next. Cases in Wilmington have started rising, and things feel unsafe and uncertain. People in recovery are used to marking time. In the early days after I quit drinking, I remember waiting to hit those markers: The first 60 days, 90 days. As though something will be different, as though being sober won’t be quite as much work. Just like with COVID: we want the work to be over and we want things to go back to some kind of normal.</p>\n<p><i>Also featured on NPR's <a class=\"link blue underline underline-hover hover-dark-red\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/programs/all-things-considered\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">All Things Considered</a>. </i></p>","audioWaveform":"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","slug":"young-and-sober-during-covid-19","authorslug":"laura-bratton"},{"type":"story","feature":"true","format":"text","location":"El Paso, TX","title":"“I Am in Juárez.

Before all this, she’d cross the border every single day. Then President Trump <a class=\"link blue underline underline-hover hover-dark-red\" href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2020/03/20/covid-19-leads-trump-announce-partial-closure-southern-border/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">closed</a> the U.S.-Mexico border to non-essential workers back in March and <a class=\"link blue underline underline-hover hover-dark-red\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-border-restrictions.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">extended</a> those restrictions “indefinitely” as of May. </p>\n<p>So even though students with the right papers can convince border agents to let them through — the process is a whole lot more uncertain now. Grecia hasn’t even tried to cross. So she’s had to forfeit her final days on campus, her community in the newsrooms of the <a class=\"link blue underline underline-hover hover-dark-red\" href=\"https://borderzine.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">magazines</a> she edits, the research she’d been doing for her philosophy class at a high school that’s now closed. </p>\n<p>The quarantine also brought about uncertainty about the future: whether her graduate program that starts this fall would actually happen. So far it looks like her courses will all be online. </p>\n<p>These types of disappointments and anxieties are commonplace for students living through the pandemic. And the border shutdown we’re experiencing has been looming as a threat since long before coronavirus. What’s different for Grecia is that she feels cut off from an entire country she used to come to each day. </p>\n<p>Even though I’m living through the lockdown too, as a U.S. student, my experience is so different from my friend’s. I wanted to find out from Grecia how the mostly-closed border has affected her life. We started by remembering her last day on campus. </p>\n<p>This interview was edited for length and clarity. </p>\n<p><b>Grecia Sánchez Blanco:</b> I still remember my last day at U.T.E.P.. I had a regular work schedule from 9 to 2 p.m. And then after that I had lunch. And then I went to do an interview for my philosophy project. And then after I finished my interview, I found out that the president of U.T.E.P. said we were going to have an extra week for spring break, and that the rest of the classes for the semester were going to be remote delivery. </p>\n<p>I didn't want to leave. I realized that was going to be my last day as a senior, as an international student. I'm walking between those buildings, just experiencing nature from that day because that's something I really like to do. I really liked — in past tense — to do, on a daily basis. </p>\n<p><b>Antonio Villaseñor-Baca: What has that time you lost meant to you? What runs through your mind, knowing that you don’t have that anymore?</b></p>\n<p><b>GSB:</b> The way I wanted to remember U.T.E.P. was taken from me, from one day to the next. I wanted to take photos in my cap and gown on the U.T.E.P. grounds, before my graduation, and that’s not going to happen anymore. That’s like a ritual for U.T.E.P. students. </p>\n<p>It has been strange. It has been frustrating. I have cried a lot, just because of what all this means. </p>\n<p>The reality is also this: I am in Juárez. And you are in El Paso. We won’t even be able to visit each other from one house to the next and the border is closed. </p>\n<p><b><i>I wanted to know if Grecia remembered a specific moment when her experience of the quarantine was different from classmates like me, who live in El Paso. She told me about a class on French films. Before quarantine, students watched films from the professor’s Amazon account. After the campus closed, they couldn’t do that anymore. </i></b></p>\n<p><b>GSB:</b> With the virus, he emailed us saying: you have two options. Tell me if you want to focus on the films and you’d have to buy the films on Amazon, or we can focus on grammar. </p>\n<p>My family earns in Mexican pesos. I earn in Mexican pesos. Both jobs I have on campus at U.T.E.P. pay me at the end of the semester, which means I don’t have U.S. dollars right now. And I told the professor, it will be really, really appreciated if you could consider my special situation as a Mexican student whose family earns in Mexican pesos, who can no longer pay for that amount in films. Right now, my expenses are allocated to only pay groceries and meals. Those are my essential expenses. I cannot afford to pay more than that. </p>\n<p>Since the virus came to paralyze the whole world, the difference between the peso and the dollar has risen significantly. The peso [is] depreciating and that deeply affects the families that earn in Mexican pesos. Including mine.  That’s basically what I told the professor. </p>\n<p>He talked to his Chair, and they were able to buy me an Amazon subscription for the rest of the semester. It’s something I appreciate so much. It shows that even under these circumstances, there are people that worry about the well-being of other people and that understand that everybody has different circumstances. Those are the things that are at the top of my mind.  </p>\n<p><b>AVB: There have been threats previously from this current U.S. administration to shut down the border. Like had you worried about this prior to [the pandemic]?</b></p>\n<p>Totally. Now I remember, it’s been two years, Trump gave the order to remove people from the bridges and remove to the processing centers, the immigrants because that “wave” of immigrants was coming. I’m talking about when there was this threat of closing this border. All of us that were crossing the border, we had to carry a change of clothes in case we got stuck on the other side. Having to pack your suitcase, for if you get stuck over here or over there. And having to notify your professors who would tell me, if you’re not here, you can’t take my class. And I have had to fight for my place in a lot of ways at U.T.E.P.. </p>\n<p><b>What did those experiences mean to you — the fact that you had to pack your bags and just be ready in case the border did get shut down? Like, that's not a normal thing that students have to worry about. </b></p>\n<p>I think it makes you prepared for the unexpected in the best possible way, It has made me embrace uncertainty, whether I want it or not. And it has made me worry about everything. I try to manage. I have a lot of, you know me, llevo un chingo de garabatos. But that's because things are always changing when you're crossing the border. My experience of the border has made me more aware of how everything can suddenly change.</p>\n<p><b>How do the U.S. elections impact you? Why does it matter to you? How does the rhetoric impact you?</b></p>\n<p>I have had harder times to cross whenever President Trump gives a speech that resonates a lot with his constituents. It gets harder for me to cross to study. I get asked more questions. I get inspected more often. I get harassed more often too, and harassment in the way of comments that tend to be hurtful. As a woman and as a philosophy major. And like I said before, I have had to fight for my place at certain classes where professors don't understand that I may be late to a class or that I may not be able to come at all, because I got inspected at the bridge. and those inspections tend to last from half an hour to two hours. It's a really long time for a student when you’re in that line and you're crossing with, ósea aún si te estás llendo de tu casa una hora antes, si te atrasas 15 minutos por el tráfico because of the bridge lines, because of the questions that agents ask. </p>\n<p><b>And just as a follow up question to that, because I feel like it very unfortunately does have to be asked in this political climate: What do you say to people who would say that that's justified? That this isn't your country? That it's in the name of national security? What do you say to those people?</b></p>\n<p>I would invite them to think about their life right now, and how the virus has impacted their life personally. Because chances are, their experience is going to be very similar to the immigrant experience in the sense that, something that is outside of your control happens, and you react the best way that you can for you, for your family, for your loved ones. I would ask them to question themselves. Because they don't seem to question themselves about what they would do if their whole life would be like they're living now.</p>","slug":"i-am-in-juarez-you-are-in-el-paso-pandemic-reflections-from-borderland","authorslug":"antonio-villasenor-baca"}],"main":{"type":"about","featured":[{"title":"I’m Conservative and COVID-19 Brings Conflicts of Political Interest","slug":"im-conservative-and-covid-19-brings-conflicts-of-political-interest"},{"title":"Barely Making It: Navigating 2020 as a Broke College Student","slug":"barely-making-it-navigating-2020-as-a-broke-college-student"}],"latest":[{"title":"To Move Forward After Bernie, a Young Progressive Looks to the Past","slug":"to-move-forward-after-bernie-a-young-progressive-looks-to-the-past"},{"title":"Life in Legal Limbo: A Dreamer Reflects","slug":"life-in-legal-limbo-a-dreamer-reflects"},{"title":"Young and Sober During COVID-19","slug":"young-and-sober-during-covid-19"},{"title":"A Minnesotan Weighs In: Is There Hope After the Hashtags?","slug":"a-minnesotan-weighs-in-is-there-hope-after-the-hashtags"},{"title":"“I Am in Juárez.
