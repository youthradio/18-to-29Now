There is a lot of speculation in mainstream media about which candidate we will vote for and how many of us will actually go to the polls, but very little attention paid to our actual experiences and perspectives when it comes to the issues being debated on the national stage. These issues are more than talking points for us. They are the struggles that define our communities and our futures. They are our stories, they need to be told, and we want to be the ones to tell them.</p>\n<p>We are excited to announce the official launch of 18-29 Now, a collaborative elections coverage project of YR Media and Radio Rookies designed to amplify the voices of the young people with the most at stake in the 2020 elections.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, YR Media and Radio Rookies carried out a national contributor search. From more than one hundred applications to our Open Call for contributors, we selected a team of 12 talented young media makers. Contributors are racially and ethnically diverse, identify across the political spectrum, and represent every region in the country. With support from YR Media and Radio Rookies editorial staff, they are producing content in audio, video, and print formats on issues including health care access, poverty, education, gun violence, LGBTQ rights, college affordability, homelessness, opioid addiction, immigration, and climate change, among others. Stories all focus on issues that directly impact the young people and their communities.</p>"},"credits":{"title":"Credits","people":[{"title":"Reporters","names":"Sydney Livingston, Ariel Tang, Zoe Harwood","slug":"reporters"},{"title":"Editors/Producers","names":"Nimah Gobir, Marjerrie Masicat, Lissa Soep","slug":"editorsproducers"},{"title":"Designer","names":"Marjerrie Masicat","slug":"designer"},{"title":"Developers","names":"Radamés Ajna, Devin Glover","slug":"developers"},{"title":"Audio Editors","names":"Galnadjee Joe-Johnson, Jacob Armenta","slug":"audio-editors"},{"title":"Researcher","names":"Rainier Harris","slug":"researcher"},{"title":"Project Lead","names":"Nimah Gobir","slug":"project-lead"}],"slug":"credits"}}}
